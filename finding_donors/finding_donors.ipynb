    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "- A real world application in Industry is for companies like Google and Yahoo to implement into the email systems. Naive Bayes can be used to sort spam email from important email based on the past preferences and opened emails of the user.\n",
    "- The strengths of Naive Bayes are that it is simple to implement into many systems, it is also very easy to train on multiple datasets; it performs well when every feature actually is independent \n",
    "- One weakness of Naive Bayes is actually the reason that it perfoms well in certain datasets, but poorly in others; it assumes that every feature is independent even if they are not; so when a dataset has features that depend on one another, naive bayes will perform poorly, hence the name naive\n",
    "- Naive Bayes is a good candidate for this problem because this is a classification problem. The program needs to classify whether or not a person will donate based on their features. Naive Bayes is simple for such problems and will perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine:\n",
    "- Support Vector machines has been widely used in many areas of biological science. They have been used to classify proteins, with up to 90% accuracy in correctly identifying the compounds\n",
    "- Some strengths of Support Vector Machines include having a regularisation parameter that help the user avoid over-fitting. Another strength includes the fact that it is defined by a convex optimisation problem meaning that the goal of an SVM is to minimize error or maximize the margin.\n",
    "- One weakness of an SVM properly choosing the right hyper parameters that properly represent the data without overfitting\n",
    "- This is a good option for the aforementioned classification problem because it involves determining whether or not a candidate is going to donate or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "- One real world use of decision trees include 3D object recognition for high level vision.\n",
    "- Strengths of Decision Trees include simply the fact that they are built around the concept of maximizing the \"usefulness\" of each branch. Each branch is designed to ask questions that divide the data into as large, even sets as possible\n",
    "- Disadvanteges of decision trees include that they can quickly overfit, or grow very large. They may also become very complex in terms of calculations if not used in the right application\n",
    "- This is a good option for the problem because we are using features with one-hot encoding. The tree would also be great for interpretation by CharityML \n",

    "**Answer: The model training times for the Gaussian and the Decision Tree are not even visible on the graph as the scaling required for the SVM is so great. This is indicative that the SVM takes up much more time in both model predicting and testing at all sample sizes. In this case though, CharityML is more concerned about its accuracy of being able to identify who makes over 50,000 so the SVM makes up for its time. For the accuracy score and F-score on the training subsets Gaussian did very poorly, while the Decision tree did better than the Gaussian and SVM. This was true at all sample sizes. When it came to predicting the models, once again the SVM did very poorly. This time however, it was able to beat both Gaussian and Decision tree on both the 10% and 100% sample sizes, coming in very close at the 1% sample size. Since using 100% of the data is most optimal for CharityML, SVM seems like the most likely candidate. The same is true for the F-score on the testing set. At 10% and 100% sample sizes, the SVM did very well. Overall, Gaussian did by far the worse of the 3 models with lower accuracy and F-scores on both the training and testing set. The Decision Tree did well, but was beat by the SVM in the prediction category, which ultimately is the most important. Based on the data given the SVM is the best for this problem. The SVM is also suitable for the data because even it makes logical sense. The SVM is used to separate data into two groups which is exactly what CharityML is trying to do. Unlike Gaussian it separates the data instead of classifying each independent event making it much more accurate."

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*"

    "**Answer: SVMs are models that focus on finding a \"line of separation\" that best divides a dataset into different classes. This line is best derived from the training examples closest to it, called the support vectors. Thus, changing or removing training examples changes this \"line of separation.\" When new data points are added, they are classified based on this line. The goal of an SVM is to maximize margins. A margin is the distance from the a given point to the line. Sometimes, it is impossible to create a line that seperates the data in 2D. Thus, something called a kernel trick is used. Based on the shape and form of the data, a third dimension or a third function often referred to as a kernel is added. Depending on the shape of the data, this kernel helps separate the data and create the \"line of separation.\""

The only difference is that I had thought education-level would be one of the top 5 important features, but education-num was selected instead. The order of which is different from what I had thought, but the reasoning behind each feature remains. This confirms that my logic was right for determining what features are best for finding out who makes over %50,000."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer: To be expected the accuracy and F-score decreased compared to using all of the features. It is very important to note that using only these 5 features as opposed to all 13, the program was able to compute faster and achieve results that were near the same accuracy. The accuracy and F-score on the reduced data was still higher than the unoptimized model. I would definitely consider using the reduced data as my training set because the reduced data trains exponentially faster."
